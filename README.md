embracer
========
This is a suite of tools to pull stock / future market data from some feed and analyze it in real time for
possible trading signals. Embracer also implemnts a general trading API that allows you to do programmed trading.

NOTE WELL -- this is still in Alpha, and if you decide to use it you take the responsibility upon yourself to
test it well before committing it to real money.

Currently, only one driver is present for OptionsXpress. You are free to write your own interfaces on a fork if you like.

This relies on FOX to give you a UI to control Embracer. Future versions may move away from this and 
use a browser interface instead.
